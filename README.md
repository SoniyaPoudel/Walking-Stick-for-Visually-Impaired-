# Walking-Stick-for-Visually-Impaired-
The study hypothesizes that a Walking Stick that alerts visually-impaired people over
obstacles in front could help them in walking with less accident. The aim of the project is
to address the development work of a cane that could communicate with the users
through voice alert and vibration, which is named Walking Stick Plus for Visually
Impaired. The development work involves coding and physical installation. A series of
tests have been carried out on the Walking Stick and the results are discussed. This study
found that the Walking Stick functions well as intended, in alerting users about the
obstacles in front.The main aim of this project is to contribute our knowledge and
services to the people of blind and disable society by certain techniques like tracking the
location of user by the use of GPS Module and send message with location to the
concerned person in case of emergency by the help of GSM Module. Also, sounding of
buzzer on detection of obstacles by ultrasonic sensor.
